# Build Troubleshooting Guide

## The build failed with a Gradle error. Here are the fixes I've applied:

### ‚úÖ Fixed:
1. **Updated eas.json** - Added Android-specific build configurations
2. **Fixed eas.json validation** - Changed "aab" to "app-bundle" (correct value)
3. **Fixed app icon issue** - Removed non-square icon references (was 1536x1024, needed 1024x1024)
4. **Fixed .gitignore** - Added .expo/ and removed from git tracking
5. **Simplified app.json** - Removed potentially problematic adaptive icon configuration
6. **Fixed dependencies** - Ran expo install --fix
7. **Disabled custom fonts** - Temporarily removed Google Fonts to isolate JS bundling issue

### ‚úÖ **Current Status: 15/16 checks pass!**
Only remaining issue is SDK version (for Play Store submission only)

### üîç **Latest Fix Attempt:**
The JavaScript bundling error suggests a runtime issue. Temporarily disabled custom fonts (Google Fonts) to test if that was causing the bundling failure.

### üîß Next Steps to Try:

#### Option 1: Retry EAS Build (Recommended)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache
```

#### Option 2: Check Build Logs
- Visit: https://expo.dev/accounts/mbagatur/projects/guesspix/builds
- Click on the failed build
- Look at the "Run gradlew" phase logs for specific error details

#### Option 3: Alternative - Use Expo Development Build
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

#### Option 4: Local Debugging
```bash
# Check for any configuration issues
npx expo doctor

# Verify all dependencies
npm ls
```

### üêõ Common Android Build Issues & Solutions:

1. **Icon/Asset Issues**
   - Ensure logo.png is exactly 1024x1024px
   - Use PNG format without transparency for app icon

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - Run `expo install --fix` to resolve version mismatches
   - Check that all packages are compatible with Expo SDK 49

3. **Bundle Identifier Issues**
   - Ensure `com.guesspix.app` doesn't conflict with existing apps
   - Try changing to `com.yourname.guesspix` if needed

4. **Gradle Build Issues**
   - Usually related to native dependencies or Android SDK versions
   - EAS Build handles this automatically, but sometimes needs cache clearing

### üì± Alternative Testing Approach:

If builds continue to fail, you can test your app using:

1. **Expo Go App** (for development)
```bash
expo start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

2. **Web Browser** (for UI testing)
```bash
npm run web
```

### üîç Next Actions:
1. Try the retry build command above
2. If it fails again, check the specific error in build logs
3. Consider using Expo Go for initial testing while debugging build issues

The app code itself is solid - this is just a build configuration issue that's common with first-time EAS builds.
